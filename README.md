# Particle-simulation
A program to graphically simulate the individual gas particles in a container and understand how they interact

What the project does:
A program to graphically simulate the individual gas particles in a container and understand how they interact

Why the project is useful:
It can be difficult to visualise the movement of individual gas particles in a container and understand how they interact as a gas under the influence of changes in temperature and pressure. A program to graphically simulate the individual particles will assist with this.

How users can get started with the project:
Download the 3 python files and single json file and run main.py
